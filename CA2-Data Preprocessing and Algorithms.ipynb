    "In this section, several aspects of machine learning are described at a high-level. Reading this section is extremely important for a clear understanding of the algorithms explained above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is the intelligence implemented into machines. This ability can be gained by performing\n",
    "statistical operations on data.\n",
    "To start the learning progress of the AI, a collection of data is be fed to the system as learning data points. The\n",
    "data fed to the AI needs to be accurate and clean – from any unnecessary information. This data is the single\n",
    "source of knowledge of AI and is the base of Artificial Intelligence.\n",
    "There are many ways AI can learn, and the most popular ways are: Machine Learning and Deep Learning.\n",
    "The human brain is programmed by the DNA that defines neural structures. These structures inside change the path\n",
    "of neural activity and organism behavior as a result of our experiences.\n",
    "There are several ways to simulate these learning mechanisms in computers [49].\n",
    "For learning to happen in both flash and silicon matter, the following are needed:\n",
    "    - A way for the system to understand what is expected of it\n",
    "    - A way for the system to remember the information needed\n",
    "    - A way for the system to input information\n",
    "    - A way for the system to output information\n",
    "    - A way to load algorithms into the system\n",
    "    - Physical matter (hardware for machines) to support all the above bullet points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the beginning of AI, the learning system has shifted from algorithms that rely on logic and rules to\n",
    "machine learning, in which case the algorithms contain fewer rules and absorb training data points to learn, as\n",
    "humans, by trial and error. \n",
    "![alt text](AiEvolution.png \"Title\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to powerful computers and big data, Machine Learning has now advanced algorithms called neural\n",
    "networks. These networks are just a collection of computing fundamentals shaped like the neurons in the human\n",
    "brain, that build stronger or weaker links as they assimilate data [50].\n",
    "This is very important, as humans, do not recognize a dog by definitions like \"if (number of legs==4, and\n",
    "tail==true, size>cat, color==\" brown or white or black)\". If this was the case, we would not be able to recognize\n",
    "a Chikwawa with 3 legs, as a dog. The goal is to make AI think and acknowledge reality as much as possible\n",
    "as close to humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a part of Artificial Intelligence, that contributes with the ability to allow a machine to learn\n",
    "and improve from input data. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can\n",
    "access data and use it for learning.\n",
    "Machine learning uses two approaches to train a model :\n",
    "     - Supervised learning, which ingests a set of input data that describes explicitly what the machine should\n",
    "focus on. These data points fed to the machine are labeled\n",
    "    - Unsupervised learning does not feed the AI with labeled data points. In this model, the machine is\n",
    "supposed to organize data on its own, based on the features of the inserted data\n",
    "Usually, the supervised learning is used when the AI model is used to make a prediction, while the unsupervised\n",
    "learning model is used when data needs to be explored.\n",
    "Machine learning gives a system the ability to learn automatically and improve from experience, without\n",
    "being precisely programmed or without any human interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following, in this section, we have a high-level look at how data is pre-processed, what algorithms are mostly used and how the training and the testing steps are achieved. In later sections, some actions are implemented and explained using Python3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## There are 3 main Machine Learning Algorithms:\n",
    "![alt text](ML_algorithms.png \"Title\")\n",
    "   ### 1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "   The supervised machine learning algorithms use labeled data to learn how the mapping function works to map the input variable with the out variable. The supervised learning algorithm consists in several types of supervised learning, but we will focus on two main types:\n",
    "   #### Classification: \n",
    "   It is used to predict the outcome of input data based on cathegories, that the model was trained to recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Regression:\n",
    "   It is used to predict the outcome of a input data when the output variable is in the form of real values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "   ### 2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "   The unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the model is fed with input data and the model itself needs to organize data on its own, based on patterns and features of the inserted data.\n",
    "   Again, there are several types of unsupervised machine learning models, but we will focus on the two main types:\n",
    "   #### Association\n",
    "   It is used to discover relations between input variables. It is highly used in the market analysis as it easily computes the probability of the co-occurrence of items in a collection.\n",
    "   #### Clustering\n",
    "   is used to group the input data as similarities are found.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   ### 3. Reinforcement Learning:\n",
    "   Reinforcement learning is a different type of algorithm, that is designed to allow an agent to predict the best next move. The decision is based on the agent's current state and by learning behaviors that maximaze, it's reward."
